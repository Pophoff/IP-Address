# IP-Address
This is a simple application in order to find the IP address of a computer, in a Tkinter window

There are 4 files included in this repository
* IP Address.exe - This is the finalized application that tells you the IP address of the computer it is running on.
* IP Address.py - This is the raw file that the Application is trying to run. If you run this in a python software you would get the same result that IP Address.exe would give you
* setup.py - This file was used if you want to use py2exe in order to create an application instead of pyinstaller (not recommended)
* Icon.ico - This is the file icon that you can attach to the executable file.

This is a solo project created for business or personal use.
