# IP-Address
This is a simple application in order to find the IP address of a computer, in a Tkinter window

There are 4 files included in this repository
* IP Address.exe - This file is the application after pyinstaller runs, trying to download it through Github would result in an unsecured file, so the rest of the files are how to get the executable manually.
* IP Address.py - This is the raw file that the Application is trying to run. If you run this in a python software you would get the same result that IP Address.exe would give you
* setup.py - This file was used if you want to use py2exe in order to create an application instead of pyinstaller (not recommended)
* Icon.ico - This is the file icon that you can attach to the executable file.

This is a solo project created for business or personal use.
